# RPN-Calculator

Hello, welcome. I hope you will like it here.

After coding this RPN calculator, I discovered that there are already existing RPN calculator apps for the Apple Watch. For that reason, you probably won't find this specific app on the Apple Store.

- "Push" adds the current input onto the stack.
- "Clear" clears the current input and the stack.
- "Del" clears the most recent digit from the current input.
- "+", "-", "*", and "/" operate on the last two numbers in the stack and replace them with the result. 

 You can enjoy the app by forking the repository, cloning it, and building it on your Apple Watch via Xcode.
