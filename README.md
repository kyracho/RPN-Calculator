Hello, welcome. I hope you will like it here.

After coding this RPN calculator, I discovered that there are already existing RPN calculator apps for the Apple Watch. For that reason, you probably won't find this specific app on the Apple Store.

- "Push" adds the current input onto the stack.
- "Clear" clears the current input and the stack.
- "Del" clears the most recent digit from the current input.
- "+", "-", "*", and "/" operate on the last two numbers in the stack and replace them with the result. 

### You can build this app on your own Apple Watch.
___
- Step 1: Clone the repository locally.
- Step 2: Open the project in Xcode.
- Step 3: Ensure the `RPN.png` file is in `RPN Calculator Watch App/Assets/Applconset`.
- Step 4: Select your device from the dropdown menu and start the active scheme.
- Step 5: Enjoy!
