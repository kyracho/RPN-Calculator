# RPN-Calculator

Perform calculations using Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) on your Apple watch.

After creating this app, I discovered that there are already existing RPN calculator apps for the Apple Watch. 

For that reason, you probably won't find this specific app on the Apple Store. 

You can still enjoy the app by forking the repository, cloning it, and building it on your Apple Watch via Xcode :)

"Push" adds the current input onto the stack.

"Clear" clears the current input and the stack.

"Del" clears the right most digit from the current input.
