The RPN Calculator app is a streamlined tool designed for performing simple calculations using Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) on your Apple Watch. 
RPN simplifies calculations by using a stack-based approach where operators follow their operands. 

**Example: **

To compute the expression `(1 + 2) * 5` using the RPN Calculator, follow these steps:

1. **Enter `1`**: Input the number `1` using the numeric buttons on the calculator, then press the "Push Stack" button to push `1` onto the stack.

2. **Enter `2`**: Input the number `2` and press the "Push Stack" button to push `2` onto the stack. Your stack now contains `1` and `2`.

3. **Press `+`**: Press the `+` button to add the last two numbers on the stack (`1` and `2`). The result, `3`, will replace those numbers on the stack.

4. **Enter `5`**: Input the number `5` and press the "Push Stack" button to push `5` onto the stack. Your stack now contains `3` and `5`.

5. **Press `*`**: Press the `*` button to multiply the last two numbers on the stack (`3` and `5`). The result, `15`, will now be on the stack.

The result, `15`, is displayed on the screen.
